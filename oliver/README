Oliver File Format
------------------


The Oliver file format is a quick demo of how formats work.   It always stores dimensions of an object.

For example, an Oliver file could contain the following information:

Toaster:  27cm x 16cm x 16cm.



The format itself is described as:


Header (4 bytes, always OLIV)
Length (in cm, 4 bytes)
Width (in cm, 4 bytes)
Height (in cm, 4 bytes)
Name of object (as string, variable length, to end of file)


Example file can be found in example.OLV
